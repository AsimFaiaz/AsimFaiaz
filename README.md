My Questionable Workflow - Dont f JUDGE.........
- C# – Why not???????
- Love UI/UX until CSS decides it hates me.
- Forever juggling front-end optimism (“it’ll be quick”) with back-end reality (“just one more migration”).
-  Fluent in Stack Overflow dialect — answers written in 2008 but still working today (tough luck).
- Known for // TODO: fix later comments that age like fine wine.
- Debugging style: add a console.log, whisper a prayer, repeat.  - Eventually will be removed Insha Allah, NOT SURE when tho.
- Side quest: proving git push -f can be a valid problem-solving technique.
- Currently spending spare time on [Zenvestify](https://github.com/AsimFaiaz/Zenvestify)
