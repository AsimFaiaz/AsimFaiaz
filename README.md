My Questionable Workflow -
- C#– Why not??????? oh also JS – Sometimes… (tolerate, good luck debugging tho) _/\_
- Love UI/UX until CSS decides it hates me.
- Forever juggling front-end optimism (“it’ll be quick”) with back-end reality (“just one more migration”).
-  Fluent in Stack Overflow dialect — answers written in 2008 but still working today (tough luck).
- Known for // TODO: fix later comments that age like fine wine.
- Debugging style: add a console.log, whisper a prayer, repeat.  - Eventually will be removed Insha Allah, NOT SURE when tho.
- Side quest: proving git push -f can be a valid problem-solving technique.
- "A man who loves a cat is a good man; a cat who loves a man is a good man" - Just saying
- Currently spending spare time on [Zenvestify](https://github.com/AsimFaiaz/Zenvestify)
